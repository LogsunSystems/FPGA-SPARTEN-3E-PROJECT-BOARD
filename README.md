# FPGA SPARTEN (3E )
## INTRODUCTION
The Spartan-3E family of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is specifically designed to meet the needs of high volume,cost-sensitive consumer electronic applications. The Spartan-3E family builds on the success of the earlier Spartan-3 family by increasing the amount of logic per I/O,
significantly reducing the cost per Logic cell.New features improve system performance and reduce the cost of configuration. These Spartan-3E FPGA enhancements,
combined with advanced 90 nm process technology, deliver more functionality and bandwidth per dollar than was previously possible,setting new standards in the
programmable logic industry. The Spartan-3E family is a superior alternative to mask programmed ASICs.PGAs avoid the high initial cost, the lengthy development cycles, and the inherent inflexibility of conventional ASICs. Also,
FPGA programmability permits design upgrades in the field with no hardware replacement necessary, an impossibility with ASICs.
